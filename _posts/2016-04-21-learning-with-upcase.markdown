Recently I've signed up for [Upcase](https://www.upcase.com/) by
[thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/). Upcase is a service that claims to build
better developers by granting them access to video tutorials, exercises,
discussions, and a community. The Vim and Tmux trails have been my favorite part
of Upcase so far.  A trail in Upcase is like a mini course with videos,
discussion, and many practical applications to apply the content.

  There are many different developers from thoughtbot that make appearances in the
  videos.  The main instructors however seem to be [Chris Toomey][chris-toomey],
  [Ben Orenstein][ben-orenstein], and [Joe Ferris][joe-ferris].

  So far, the content is really good, but the service lacks a sense of
  direction.  A tremendous amount of content is presented to the user with no
  clear indication of where to begin.  After signing up, I find myself wishing
  for this kind of structure to the courses.  I personally started with the vim
  and tmux trails, and they have been amazing.

  There are videos on testing, workflow, clean code (design patterns/refactoring),
  and much more.

  Check out [Upcase][upcase].

I spend a lot of time at work commuting and waiting for client meetings.  Recently I purchased a [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite) in effort to stop lugging around huge technical books.  In the search for convenience, I had noticed more and more authors and publications providing pdf, mobi, epub, and kindle versions of their works.


> "Rails Guides are also available on kindle"

That was a link that popped out at me when browsing the [rails
guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/). I immediately put it on my kindle and paged through a few sections. The guide flows well on kindle with a few exceptions in code examples.  Using the kindle you can also search through the whole guide.

The guides are available for EDGE rails and earlier releases as well. The current available guides are: Rails 4.2, Rails 4.1, Rails 4.0, Rails 3.2, and Rails 2.3.

Now you can stay up to date when on the road without an internet connection!

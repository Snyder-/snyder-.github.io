I spend a lot of time at work commuting and waiting for client meetings.  Recently I've acquired a [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite) so I don't have to lug around huge technical books.  Shopping around I've noticed more and more authors and publications providing pdf, mobi, epub, and kindle versions of their works.
